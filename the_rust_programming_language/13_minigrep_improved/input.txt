The dragon landed on the castle. The castle couldn't move an inch.
Even when the knight appeared, she was unable to block any attack.

"Viscount Barreaux, what a terrible opponent you are."

A certain someone talked from a small part of the castle and spoke in a low voice.

"Humph, she's only a terrible match for me."

This voice was someone's. There was no doubt it was him.

The person who came out was Lionel, his son. He made a glad expression and sat down on the ground.

"Well, you see? I'm the stronger person, right? My prince is here."
